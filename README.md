# Little Lemon Final Project 🍋

This repository contains my final project for the **Meta Front-End Developer** course on Coursera.

The app was built with **React**, using **Chakra UI**, **Formik**, **Yup**, and other modern libraries to create an intuitive reservation experience for the fictional restaurant _Little Lemon_.

## How to Run the Project

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## How to Run the Tests

You can run all tests with either of the following commands:

```bash
npm test
```

or

> All tests will execute automatically. No need to press any keys or select filters.
